# Next.js with App Router best practices

- Use Next.js file-based routing.
- Use Next.js API route handlers for backend logic.
- Use zod schemas for validation.
- Where relevant, use `loading.tsx` for loading states and `error.tsx` for error pages.
- Prefer RSC, SSR, SSG. Use client components only when necessary for interactivity.
